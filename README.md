# Stewart-Platform---MSC-Adams
A 6 DOF Mechanism which can move using MSC Adams software.

The repo represnts a Mechanical Mechanism I have worked on wihch have a 6 DOF and used in the planes simulation. You can find the 3D model in a folder 
named "Stewart platform" then you can find the MSC adams Simulation in the folder "Adams 12". Although you can find the required motions I have created by open
a new database form MSC Adams. notice that I have created a folder for each data base with the name of the motions.

** Note ** 
The emplemented equations have been done according to geometry and calculations which is only sutble for my model.
